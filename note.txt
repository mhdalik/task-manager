single-page Task Management feature that allows users to
create, manage, and filter their daily tasks.

TECH STACK
- Laravel API Backend
- Frontend blade with ajax styled with Bootstrap.

Core Requirements:
- tasks table
 * title (String, required)
 * description (Text, optional)
 * is_completed (Boolean, default false)
 * due_date (Timestamp, optional)
- Seeder with at least 5 initial dummy tasks.
2. API Development
- CRUD API using a Laravel Resource Controller
- api resourse routing (/api/tasks).
- use TaskResource for all responses for consistent and well-structured JSON output

- add filter option in (GET /api/tasks) api (optional query params)
 * Dynamic Filtering: The (GET /api/tasks) must accept an optional filter query parameter. Use Eloquent's when() clause to implement the following logic:
 * ?filter=completed: Return only tasks where is_completed is true.
 * ?filter=pending: Return only tasks where is_completed is false.

3. Frontend Implementation (Bootstrap & JavaScript)
- frontend must in single view, communicate  via getch api or AJAX
- layout should responsive and visually distinguishes completed tasks (e.g., using a strikethrough or
different card color).

 * Initial Load: Fetch and render all tasks dynamically when the page loads.
 * Implement Task Creation form that sends an AJAX request to the API.
 * The task list must update dynamically upon successful creation.
 * add controls (buttons/checkboxes) on each task to Toggle its Completion Status (PATCH
request) and Delete the task (DELETE request).
 * The UI must update immediately and dynamically for these actions.
 * Dynamic Filtering Controls: Implement buttons or a dropdown for the user to select and apply
the "All," "Completed," or "Pending" filters. Selecting an option must trigger a new AJAX request
with the correct filter query parameter and completely redraw the list.
 * Feedback: Use a Bootstrap Toast or Alert component to give the user success or error feedback
after any action (Create, Update, Delete).
💡 Submission Guidelines
 * Provide a GitHub repository link containing the full, runnable Laravel project.
